        <h1>Sarah Hontoy-Major, but call me Sarah Hm.</h1>
        <p>
          I think as myself first and foremost as a fashion design graduate,
          although I have a lot more layers to what I do that further the
          inter-disciplinary approach I try to take when experimenting and
          creating.
        </p>

        <p>
          I graduated from Dawson College in the North-South Social Science
          profile, centered around politics and humanitarian development, before
          beginning my Fashion Design technical program at Marie-Victorin
          College in 2017. I have always been drawn to changing things when I
          did not like the course it was taking, and I strongly believed I could
          do that through political actions. At the time, I did not like
          compromises enough to buy into the idea that I would potentially have
          to sell my soul to an organization’s greater good, so I made a big
          switch.
        </p>
        <p>
          I followed one of my greatest passions, and it led me to Marie
          Victorin. I also worked for Vestechpro, a research center on
          innovative apparel on Marie Victorin’s campus and helped develop
          sustainable production chains for major local apparel manufacturers
          over the course of a few months.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was always adamant that I would find a way to come back to my
          political roots, though I did not quite know how. As I continue my
          formal education and start a new chapter of my life amongst Concordia
          University’s Fine Arts department in Computation Arts, I know that
          through interdisciplinary art, I can take my message across using what
          I know about political action, apparels, sustainable development as
          well as creative computation, web development, design and integration
          of technology on wearable devices.
