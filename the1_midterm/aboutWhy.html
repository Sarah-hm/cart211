        The Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQIAA+ of what is currently Canada
        are not protected by the same standards as other Canadian citizens. That
        is not up for debate and should be considered a nonpartisan objective
        truth. The National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and
        Girls published in 2019 set in stone, through thorough testimonies,
        articles, and statistics, that a crisis we long knew existed was indeed
        happening (National Inquiry 2019). <br /><br />
        What should be questioned instead are the reasons Canadians of white
        settler decent do not care more about saving those who lent us the lands
        we live on. Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQIAA+ are disappearing
        and being killed at an alarming rate, most cases are left unsolved. We
        all know about it; it has been reported many times, solutions have been
        found (National Inquiry 2019). Yet, we do not act upon it to change
        anything. Why is that?

        It would have a lot to do with psychic numbing, according to psychology
        professor Paul Slovic of the University of Oregon. The idea behind this
        theory is that we become vaguely indifferent to human tragedies as we
        lose the sense of context of large numbers that are not attached to
        individual faces and stories. We lose grasp of the extent of those
        statistics and therefore are not receptive to them (Slovic 2007). This
        means that we would feel a lot more emotions towards the lost of a
        single known, even for a brief moment, individual than the one of a
        large group of people, regardless how tragic the event leading to their
        disappearance is. Slovic even experimented on this. Given three
        possibilities, Slovic concluded that people will donate more after
        learning about one lived experience rather than getting educated on
        statistics of the matter or even learning about statistics as well as
        the individual lived experience (Slovic 2007). That is to say that even
        if the individual factor would be added to the equation, there would
        still be a need to remove the grandiose numbers to not scare off people
        from taking action. How do we then remove the pressuring factor from a
        crisis that has affected all three territories and 10 provinces of what
        is currently Canada? How are we able to look beyond the statistics and
        into the individual lived experiences of the lost sisters, while
        recognizing that this is not an alienated problem, it is a genocide?

        First, the text was intentionally written to ignore any statistics
        related to the MMIWG. That is a conscious choice. Other resources have
        somewhat fulfilled that role, even if much more information and data is
        needed into the matter. Nevertheless, to experiment on Slovic’s
        theories, large numbers will be omitted from this project. Instead,
        users will be able to focus on a single girl, woman or 2SLGBTQIAA+,
        randomly chosen as they press the ‘1’ on the homepage. This will take
        them to a brief randomly scattered around their ‘desk’. This is the
        brief of the 1 that is going to matter for them today. They will not be
        able to learn about another girl, woman or 2SLGBTQIAA+ (unless they
        reload the website, of course). They will be able to go through
        articles, pictures, and videos by zooming and clicking on them. Some
        transitions and animations will be added to accentuate the ephemeral
        life she lived on earth. Call to actions specific to every individual
        will be added in a clear way, as well as the path to find more
        information about her. Everything will be created to learn about her,
        lived experiences of those affected by her, media coverage as well as
        political changes that were impacted by her. In an attempt to approach
        this work within a decolonizing perspective, I will reduce to a minimum
        my voice within those briefs. This will reduce the chances that my
        biased opinion originating from my heritage as a white settler
        transcends the content of my project.
