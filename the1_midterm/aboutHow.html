        Only "The 1" will appear by default. The user will have to hover over
        the lower part of the page in order to make the 'About' link appear, to
        emphasize on the simplicity of the first page. <br />
        The '1' is an hyperlink to a randomly selected brief. The user cannot
        chose another one, or come back. They will need to reload the website in
        order to chose, randomly, another brief.

        You will find more information regarding the reasons and backstory to
        how this project came to realization. Spoiler alert: it's a mix of
        psychic numbing and critically having to gain consciousness on the MMIWG
        crisis in Canada.

        This is the complete brief of one single woman/girl. The user will be
        able to interact, zoom in, watch or read excerpts about her life and
        lived-experiences by those affected by her disappearance before media
        coverage and political aspects of her case.

        The layout of the page will be loaded randomly everytime, emphasizing on
        the one time experience the user will have with this brief. There will
        be no experience exactly like the previous one.
        <br />
        Call to action for this specific case will be attached to the brief,
        throughout the webpage and with bigger, clearer buttons at the bottom of
        the page. <br />
        The information and full articles/videos/etc will be made available at
        the bottom of the brief.
