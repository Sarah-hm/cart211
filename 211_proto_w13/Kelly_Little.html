          <h4>24 years old, from kahnawake Mohawk Territory</h4>
          <article class="entry">
            <p>
              Tiffany Morrison was a 24-year-old mother of one when she went
              missing from the Kahnawake Mohawk Territory in Quebec in June
              2006. The Kahnawake Mohawk Peacekeepers were responsible for the
              missing persons file. Four years later, the provincial police
              force for the province took over the investigation when Tiffany’s
              remains were found in a wooded area near the Honoré Mercier
              Bridge. The Sûreté du Québec is currently in charge of the
              homicide investigation, and
              <b>the family last spoke with police in December 2014.</b>

              Tiffany Morrison, a mother of one, left a LaSalle bar on the night
              June 18, 2006 but never made it. [...]

            <p>
              A decade after her disappearance, Morrison's family and friends
              held a vigil and march at the very spot that her remains were
              found to shed light on her unsolved case.

              "It's heartbreaking that
              <b>it's been 10 years and we still have to push for information</b
              >," said Tiffany's sister, Melanie Morrison.[...]
            </p>
            <p>
              "The family's still strongly looking for justice.
              <b
                >Somebody knows something. She didn't just end up in the wooded
                area, on her own,"</b

              Melanie Morrison said. [...]

            <p>
              "It is one of many open cases across Canada, even cases where
              bodies are found there are still no one held accountable for the
              death," she said. McDonald says
              <b
                >the lack of accountability leads many Indigenous families to
                question: "Does anybody even care? Does anybody remember?"</b

            12 years after Tiffany Morrison vanished, change has come to how
            police handle missing person cases
          </h3>

            <p>Melanie Morrisons, Tiffany's sister, says :</p>
            <p>
              The night Tiffany went missing she was at a bar in LaSalle, a
              Montreal neighbourhood that is less than a ten-minute drive across
              the St. Lawrence River to Kahnawà:ke. She got into a taxi with a
              fellow community member and the cab drove them back to Kahnawà:ke.
              Tiffany never made it home. [...]
            </p>
            <p>“He is the last person to see her,” says Morrison.</p>
            <p>
              “<b
                >He said he'd take a lie detector test, then four days before he
                bowed out</b
              >
              for religious reason, saying his longhouse wouldn't let him.”
              [...]
            </p>
            <p>
              “The initial taking of the missing person's file, the info, '<b
                >she might've just went out drinking, she's young,</b
              >'” says Morrison, frustration still apparent in her voice.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the discovery of Tiffany's remains the case was classified
              as a homicide, meaning the SQ would take over. It took a year to
              transfer the case to SQ investigators.
              <b
                >“People had to be called in to back for statements because they
                hadn't taken statements</b
              >,” says Morrison.
