  <h2>FASHION IS A PLAYGROUND</h2>
  <p>Everyday, we create our own individual fashion brand and narrative. If one does not consider oneself a fashion enthusiast; this is in itself a fashion choice. Wearing solely white t-shirts and a pair of socks with your scandals is a fashion choice. Not a great one, but it is one.</p>

  <h3>So if you believe</h3>
  <p>The idea we have been sold of fashion;</p>
  <p>The idea that these commercial narratives are the only way to go;</p>
  <p>The idea that your own personal fashion can be found within the pages of a Vogue magazine;</p>
  <h3>Then you have missed the entire point of fashion</h3>

  <h2>Because Fashion is a Playground</h2>
