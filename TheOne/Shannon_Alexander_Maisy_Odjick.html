          <h3>Maisy Odjick and Shannon Alexander</h3>
          <h4>from Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg Nation</h4>
          <article class="entry">
            <p>
              Shannon Alexander, 17, is described as a very outgoing person who
              loved to stay physically fit and was looking forward to nursing
              school. She was from Maniwaki, Que., a member of Kitigan Zibi
              Anishinabeg Nation. On Sept. 6, 2008, she disappeared from
              Maniwaki with her friend, Maisy Odjick, 16. Odjick was supposed to
              spend the night at Shannon’s house after they went to a dance, the
              next day their belongings were found but they were not seen.
              Originally they were both listed as runaways and the family
              believes that stalled the investigation. In 2017, the police
              received new information about her disappearance which led
              investigators to conduct a search of Kitigan Zibi reserve in
              Québec.

          <h3>The night of the disappearance</h3>
          <h4>As told by Laurie, Maisy`s mother</h4>
          <article class="entry">
            <p>
              The girls told [Laurie] they were going to a school dance.They
              went to the Maniwaki arena for the dance that night. Other friends
              who were at the dance saw the girls leave the arena. That was the
              last time anyone saw either girl.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Shannon’s father, Brian Alexander, returned to his apartment,
              Laurie said
              <b
                >he found the girls had left behind their purses, wallets,
                identification and backpacks. Shannon had even left her
                medication behind.</b
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Laurie said she believes the investigation into Maisy’s
              disappearance was mishandled from the beginning by Kitigan Zibi
              police.She said her daughter and her friend were labelled as
              runaways. “<b
                >The apartment that Shannon’s dad and her lived in at the time
                wasn’t even searched</b
              >,” Laurie said.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b
                >She said her family never got a file number and the police
                didn’t notify media about the disappearance.</b
              >
              “I mean, even the chief and council, nobody ...
              <b>it seemed like nobody cared at the time</b>,” Laurie said.
              After a month went by, the police notified the public. But Laurie
              feels that valuable evidence was lost by then. [...]
            </p>
            <p>
              Laurie said she realizes she may never get any answers as to what
              happened to her daughter. She said the lead police investigator
              has told her that Maisy's file may soon be shelved.

            <p>
              The runaway label just didn’t sit with the family, McConini said,
              so they pressed the police.

            <p>
              “They didn’t do anything until ... how long after, and then they
              changed their files saying they’re not runaways and saying that
              they were missing,” she said.

          <h3>Renewed Hope</h3>
          <h4>July 2017</h4>
          <article class="entry">
            <p>
              In July 2017, there was renewed hope for Laurie and her family.
              The SQ received a new tip on the girls’ disappearance, leading
              investigators to conduct a search at the Kitigan Zibi reserve.
            </p>
            <p>
              Investigators searched Pitobig Creek and the surrounding area in
              Kitigan Zibi. They also interviewed about 20 people.The search
              hasn’t led to any breaks in the investigation, but the SQ say the
              investigation will continue.
            </p>
            <p>
              [Maisy's mother] firmly believes
              <b
                >there are people out there who know what happened to her
                daughter and her best friend. "I mean, two girls don't just
                disappear off the face of the Earth. And I'm hoping one day
                those people who do know something step forward,</b

          <h3>Maisy Marie Odjick</h3>
          <h4>
            16 years old the night she disappeared
          </h4>
          <article class="entry">
            <p>
              “Just seeing her face, her eyes and counting her little fingers
              and toes,” Laurie said while reflecting on the day she gave birth
              to Maisy.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I was already in love because I felt her for nine months, but to
              see her, hold her, it’s just simply amazing and such a gift.
              That’s something I will cherish for the rest of my life.” […]
            </p>
            <p>
              Laurie said Maisy and [Shannon] were average teenage girls. They
              went to high school, gossiped about boys and socialized at the
              popular local hangouts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Neither girl was in trouble with the law nor did they lead
              high-risk lifestyles. So when the two suddenly disappeared, it was
              a shock to everyone who knew them.

              The nearly nine years since her daughter's disappearance has been
              "hell," Odjick said.
            </p>
            <p>
              "It's like a parent's worst nightmare, not knowing. Not knowing is
              the thing that hits me the hardest."
            </p>
            <p>
              "You have this in your heart where you don't want them to find
              anything, but then as a family you want closure," she said, with
              tears beginning to fill her eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
              "To actually pinpoint on how you feel. I can't, I can't describe

            <p>
              McGregor said he feels much the same, adding the eventual
              "emotional relief" will lift a weight the family has been carrying
              for too long.
